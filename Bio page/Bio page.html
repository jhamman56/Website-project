    <p id="first paragraph">
     I was born in Mesa, Arizona. My family moved around a bit due to
     work opportunities for my father, living in Tuscon, Arizona, Keller, 
     Texas, and Rio Rancho, New Mexico, before we ended up back in Arizona,
     living in Queen Creek. When we arrived in Queen Creek, it was the summer
     before I would start the seventh grade. It was here that I would finish
     out my education through Highschool.

    <p id="second paragraph">
        I grew up in the LDS church, or Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder
        Day Saints. Shortly after I graduated from highschool, it came time
        for me to start preparing to devote two years to serve a mission for
        my church. I submitted my papers to receive a call that would give me
        my assignment for this mission, and after some time received that call.
        I was assigned to go to Denver, Colorado on a Spanish speaking mission,
        to which I dedicated the next two years of my life.
    </p>
    <p id="third paragraph">
        After my mission, I came back home to live with my parents. After
        taking it easy there for a couple months, it came time for me to
        get a job. During highschool I had worked at a movie theater, but now 
        I needed to get a job that pays more than minimum wage, to start preparing
        myself for the future. After searching for a bit, I was able to secure
        a job with Wells Fargo as a bank teller. I would work here for about 
        a year and a half.
    </p>
    <p id="fourth paragraph">
        While I was working at Wells Fargo, I also started attending Chandler
        Gilbert Community College to work towards a degree. Additionally, after
        some time had passed, my parents convinced me to make an attempt 
        on the dating scene. I was hesitant about this, as I had, previously,
        had little luck when it came to dating and was content spending most
        of my time alone or with friends and family. I was rewarded immediately
        for trying, though, and met the beautiful woman who would become my wife,
        Danielle.
    </p>
    <p id="fifth paragraph">
        I downloaded a dating app on my phone in order to meet people, 
        I had a few matches, but I was still too shy to actually ask someone
        out. While messaging Danielle, however, she mentioned that she 
        enjoyed watching movies, and so I invited her to see the new Jumanji
        movie that had come out that year (2018) and we went and saw that as our first
        date. Movie and dinner dates occupied a large portion of our relationship, since it
        was apparently the best I could come up with.
    </p>
    <p id="sixth paragraph">
        After we went on several dates, we both knew that we wanted to 
        spend the rest of our lives together. With that, I started planning
        out how I would propose to her. It was important to me that a lot
        of people were around, because I wanted it to be public how much
        I loved her, and with the Phoenix Comic-con coming up, the idea
        struck me. She was and is a fan of Disney movies, particularly 
        the 80's and 90's era of animated movies. Also, Ming-na Wen, the
        voice actress of Mulan, would be doing a panel at Comic-con.
