    <p id="first paragraph">
     I was born in Mesa, Arizona. My family moved around a bit due to
     work opportunities for my father, living in Tuscon, Arizona, Keller, 
     Texas, and Rio Rancho, New Mexico, before we ended up back in Arizona,
     living in Queen Creek. When we arrived in Queen Creek, it was the summer
     before I would start the seventh grade. It was here that I would finish
     out my education through Highschool.

        I grew up in the LDS church, or Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder
        Day Saints. Shortly after I graduated from highschool, it came time
        for me to start preparing to devote two years to serve a mission for
        my church.
