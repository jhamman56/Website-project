    <p id="first paragraph">
     I was born in Mesa, Arizona. My family moved around a bit due to
     work opportunities for my father, living in Tuscon, Arizona, Keller, 
     Texas, and Rio Rancho, New Mexico, before we ended up back in Arizona,
     living in Queen Creek. When we arrived in Queen Creek, it was the summer
     before I would start the seventh grade. It was here that I would finish
     out my education through Highschool.

    <p id="second paragraph">
        I grew up in the LDS church, or Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder
        Day Saints. Shortly after I graduated from highschool, it came time
        for me to start preparing to devote two years to serve a mission for
        my church. I submitted my papers to receive a call that would give me
        my assignment for this mission, and after some time received that call.
        I was assigned to go to Denver, Colorado on a Spanish speaking mission,
        to which I dedicated the next two years of my life.

    <p id="third paragraph">
        After my mission, I came back home to live with my parents. After
        taking it easy there for a couple months, it came time for me to
        get a job. During highschool I had worked at a movie theater, but now 
        I needed to get a job that pays more than minimum wage, to start preparing
        myself for the future. After searching for a bit, I was able to secure
        a job with Wells Fargo as a bank teller. I would work here for about 
        a year and a half.
